# Monoswap Token Lists

### How to Add a Token

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add the token details to an existing token list under [tokenLists](src/constants/tokenLists).
3. Create a new folder named after the contract address in [img](/img) and add an image named `logo.png` for each token in the list. If you add a new logo, make sure you use PNG versions.
4. Once you're done, create a pull request (PR) with your changes.
